*My 3 favorite movies with descriptions*

- Zombieland: Double Tap
> Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock move to the American heartland as they face off against evolved zombies, fellow survivors, and the growing pains of the snarky makeshift family.
> Plot. Six years after the events of the first film, survivors Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock have become experts in identifying and disposing of various zombies. Since then, they have set up their new home in the abandoned White House.
- The King's Man
> In the early years of the 20th century, the Kingsman agency is formed to stand against a cabal plotting a war to wipe out millions.
> As a collection of history's worst tyrants and criminal masterminds gather to plot a war to wipe out millions, one man must race against time to stop them. Discover the origins of the very first independent intelligence agency in "The King's Man."
- Now You See Me 3
> The Now You See Me film series consists of heist-thriller films, based on original characters created by Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt. The overall plot centers on a team of illusionists named The Four Horsemen, who use their stage productions as a means of completing unfeasible and lucrative heists. The movies feature an ensemble cast including: Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Lizzy Caplan, and Morgan Freeman.
> Now You See Me 3 will be different than the previous sequels. However, the storyline is tightly kept under wraps to avoid fans' speculations. Albeit, the making of the third movie was a pre-decided project, the announcement of Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch's addition was made later.
> Now You See Me 3 will focus on a new style of robbery. This angle will certainly require some new faces. Some diehard fans believe that Benedict Cumberbatch will be seen as a villain or a cop in the movie.
